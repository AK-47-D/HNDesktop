# HNDesktop
A (Java) Swing desktop application Hacker News client written in Kotlin. I think it would be funny to make it actually goodâ€”contribute if you think so too. Or if you think the world actually needs this, that's okay too.

More background on the project here (and a **video** of it running!): http://symbolflux.com/projects/hndesktop

To build/run:

1) Install Maven (`brew install maven` or `sudo apt-get install maven`)
2) cd to HNDesktop repo root
3) run `mvn package` (this builds the project with Maven)
4) `java -jar target/HNDesktop-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar`
